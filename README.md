# Todo app

Project in which a person can create a list of tasks, edit them, delete them, and mark them as completed.

CFor this project, redux and reduxjs-tooltip were used to maintain the updated state of the application. In turn, a function with localStorage was implemented so that the information persists even if the browser is closed or updated.
